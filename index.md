## Case Study: Titanic
This case study was used to increase my knowledge on python graphics and logistic regression. This was a structured case study that I received from my Data Science masterâ€™s program at Bellevue. I filled out the skeleton code to complete the assignment. I feel confident that I could replicate this analysis on another data set in the future.
